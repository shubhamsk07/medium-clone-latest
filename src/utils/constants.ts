  In the ever-evolving landscape of creative work, it's easy to lose sight of why we started creating in the first place. Between the pressure to produce, the influence of social media, and the comparison trap that many artists fall into, creatives can find themselves burnt out, uninspired, or simply disconnected from their original purpose. That’s why I believe it’s important for every creative—whether you’re a writer, designer, musician, or filmmaker—to pause at least once a year and reflect deeply on your journey.

  Here are eight questions that I’ve found to be incredibly powerful:

  1. What originally inspired me to start creating?
  2. What kind of projects bring me the most fulfillment?
  3. Have I grown in the way I hoped creatively this past year?
  4. Am I saying "yes" to work that truly aligns with my values?
  5. What boundaries do I need to set to protect my creativity?
  6. Who am I creating for—and why?
  7. Do I still love the process, or just the outcome?
  8. What does success look like to me now?

  Taking the time to answer these honestly can help realign your creative compass. When we stop and evaluate, we often rediscover the joy, play, and exploration that drew us in before algorithms and deadlines took over.

  It’s not about having perfect answers. It’s about being willing to ask. That willingness keeps you grounded in authenticity, which ultimately resonates far more with audiences than perfection ever could.

  Whether you journal these answers, discuss them with a mentor, or meditate on them quietly—make space for this check-in. Your creative future depends on it.

  Stay curious. Stay grounded. Stay wild.
